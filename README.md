# Dynamic List Organizer

This plugin gives the user ability to:

1. Make a list of forms with hierachical structure
2. clone a section of a form
3. destroy a section of a form
4. indent a section of a form to assign / show the hierachical levels
5. outdent a section of a form to assign / show the hierachical levels

Every update on the forms will update each section with unique IDs, names, and labels to maintain accessibility and work with the database.
